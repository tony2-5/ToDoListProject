# ToDoListProject
  This is a project where I created a to-do list. Users can create projects and add to-do items that are unique to that project. For each to-do item, users must assign a title and priority, and optionally, assign a description and due date. Users can delete both projects and to-do items, and can edit any to-do item after it is created. This project has local storage persistence using the Web Storage API.

## How Its Made
### Technology used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Webpack
  Going into this project I wanted to practice some javascript and web development fundamentals. Specifically I wanted practice javascript objects, javascript modules, and bundling with webpack. With that in mind the majority of this project is built with javascript. Besides a small amount of the structure and a few images I layed out in the HTML, the rest of the website is generated using the javascript DOM. The core of the functionality of this project comes from an object oriented model for the projects, todo items, and all projects as a whole. Using objects for each of these I was able to seperate each project and their todo items and neatly display content to the user depending on which project they wanted to use. Other than the core functionality, I implemented features for better user experience such as editing to-do items, deleting to-do items, and marking todo items as complete. I also tried my best to make the website presentable using CSS.

## What I Learned
  Through this project I deepened my understanding of javascript, node package manager, and webpack. Having a project focused around javascript modules and objects allowed me to explore new parts of the langauge and find an efficient way to organize code in my web development projects. Using npm and webpack allowed me to reinforce the work flow behind implementing and managing dependencies with npm, and bundling my javascript files with webpack. I also experimented with local storage persistence using the javascript Web Storage API.
